# HTML 5 Video Player
The html 5 video play is "the most lite wight" video player, as long as you have a web browsers that supports html 5.

If you can watch YouTube, you should be just fine! 

## Why!? 
Well I made this both as a joke and it actually is quite handy for my personal use, I rarely have media files downloaded locally so I never had a need to VLC.   
On top of that I wanna use this project to get my foot wet in AUR ocean
